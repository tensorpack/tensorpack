Bug Reports/Feature Requests/Usage Questions Only:

Bug Reports:
Some part of code (either the library or examples) doesn't work as expected.
Always include the following:
1. What you did. (command you run if using examples; post or describe your code if not)
2. What you observed. (training logs)
3. What you expected, if not obvious
4. Your environment (TF version, GPUs), if it matters.

Feature Requests:
1. Improve an existing feature.
2. Add a new feature. Please note that, you can implement a lot of features by extending tensorpack
	(See http://tensorpack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/index.html#extend-tensorpack).
	It may not have to be added to tensorpack unless you have a good reason.
3. Note that we don't implement papers at other's requests.

Usage Questions, e.g.:
"How do I do [this specific thing] in tensorpack?"
"Why certain examples need to be written in this way?"
We don't answer general machine learning questions like:
"I want to do [this machine learning task]. What specific things do I need to do?"
