Bug Reports/Feature Requests/Usage Questions Only:

Bug Reports: PLEASE always include
1. What you did. (command you run if using examples; post or describe your code if not)
2. What you observed, e.g. logs.
3. What you expected, if not obvious.
4. Your environment (TF version, cudnn version, number & type of GPUs), if it matters.
5. About efficiency, PLEASE first read http://tensorpack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/performance-tuning.html

Feature Requests:
1. Improve an existing feature.
2. Add a new feature. Please note that, you can implement a lot of features by extending tensorpack
	(See http://tensorpack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/index.html#extend-tensorpack).
	It may not have to be added to tensorpack unless you have a good reason.
3. Note that we don't implement papers at others' requests.

Usage Questions, e.g.:
"How do I do [this specific thing] in tensorpack?"
"Why certain examples need to be written in this way?"
We don't answer general machine learning questions like:
"I want to do [this machine learning task]. What specific things do I need to do?"

You can also use gitter (https://gitter.im/tensorpack/users) for more casual discussions.
