name: Using/Understanding Tensorpack
about: More general questions about Tensorpack.

+ Read the [tutorials](http://tensorpack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/index.html#user-tutorials) first.
+ We answer "HOW to do X with Tensorpack" for a well-defined X.
  We also answer "HOW/WHY Tensorpack does X" for some X that Tensorpack or its examples are doing.

  We __don't__ answer general machine learning questions, such as "why my training doesn't converge", "what networks to use" or "I don't understand the paper".

You can also use gitter (https://gitter.im/tensorpack/users) for more casual discussions.
