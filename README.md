## Features:

It's Yet Another TF high-level API, with the following highlights:

1. Focus on __training speed__.
  + Speed comes for free with Tensorpack -- it uses TensorFlow in the __efficient way__ with no extra overhead.
    On common CNNs, it runs training [1.2~5x faster](https://github.com/tensorpack/benchmarks/tree/master/other-wrappers) than the equivalent Keras code.
    Your training can probably gets faster if written with Tensorpack.

  + Scalable data-parallel multi-GPU / distributed training strategy is off-the-shelf to use.
    See [tensorpack/benchmarks](https://github.com/tensorpack/benchmarks) for more benchmarks.

2. Squeeze the best data loading performance of Python with [`tensorpack.dataflow`](https://github.com/tensorpack/dataflow).
  + Symbolic programming (e.g. `tf.data`) [does not](https://tensorpack.readthedocs.io/tutorial/philosophy/dataflow.html#alternative-data-loading-solutions)
    offer the data processing flexibility needed in research.
    Tensorpack squeezes the most performance out of __pure Python__ with various autoparallelization strategies.

3. Focus on reproducible and flexible research:
  + Built and used by researchers, we provide high-quality [reproducible implementation of papers](https://github.com/tensorpack/tensorpack#examples).

4. It's not a model wrapper.
  + There are too many symbolic function wrappers already. Tensorpack includes only a few common layers.
    You can use any TF symbolic functions inside Tensorpack, including tf.layers/Keras/slim/tflearn/tensorlayer/....

See [tutorials and documentations](http://tensorpack.readthedocs.io/tutorial/index.html#user-tutorials) to know more about these features.

## Examples:

We refuse toy examples.
Instead of showing tiny CNNs trained on MNIST/Cifar10,
we provide training scripts that reproduce well-known papers.

We refuse low-quality implementations.
Unlike most open source repos which only __implement__ papers,
[Tensorpack examples](examples) faithfully __reproduce__ papers,
demonstrating its __flexibility__ for actual research.

## Install:

Dependencies:

+ Python 3.3+.
+ Python bindings for OpenCV. (Optional, but required by a lot of features)
+ TensorFlow â‰¥ 1.5
  * TF is not not required if you only want to use `tensorpack.dataflow` alone as a data processing library
  * When using TF2, tensorpack uses its TF1 compatibility mode. Note that a few examples in the repo are not yet migrated to support TF2.
```
pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/tensorpack/tensorpack.git
# or add `--user` to install to user's local directories
```

Please note that tensorpack is not yet stable.
If you use tensorpack in your code, remember to mark the exact version of tensorpack you use as your dependencies.
