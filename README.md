## Features:

It's Yet Another TF high-level API, with __speed__, and __flexibility__ built together.

1. Focus on __training speed__.
	+ Speed comes for free with Tensorpack -- it uses TensorFlow in the __efficient way__ with no extra overhead.
	  On common CNNs, it runs training [1.2~5x faster](https://github.com/tensorpack/benchmarks/tree/master/other-wrappers) than the equivalent Keras code.
		Your training can probably gets faster if written with Tensorpack.

	+ Data-parallel multi-GPU/distributed training strategy is off-the-shelf to use.
    It scales as well as Google's [official benchmark](https://www.tensorflow.org/performance/benchmarks).

	+ See [tensorpack/benchmarks](https://github.com/tensorpack/benchmarks) for
    some benchmark scripts.

2. Focus on __large datasets__.
	+ [You don't usually need `tf.data`](https://tensorpack.readthedocs.io/tutorial/philosophy/dataflow.html#alternative-data-loading-solutions).
    Symbolic programming often makes data processing harder.
	  Tensorpack helps you efficiently process large datasets (e.g. ImageNet) in __pure Python__ with autoparallelization.

3. It's not a model wrapper.
	+ There are too many symbolic function wrappers in the world. Tensorpack includes only a few common models.
	  But you can use any symbolic function library inside Tensorpack, including tf.layers/Keras/slim/tflearn/tensorlayer/....

See [tutorials and documentations](http://tensorpack.readthedocs.io/tutorial/index.html#user-tutorials) to know more about these features.

## Examples:

We refuse toy examples.
Instead of showing tiny CNNs trained on MNIST/Cifar10,
we provide training scripts that reproduce well-known papers.

We refuse low-quality implementations.
Unlike most open source repos which only __implement__ papers,
[Tensorpack examples](examples) faithfully __reproduce__ papers,
demonstrating its __flexibility__ for actual research.

## Install:

Dependencies:

+ Python 3.3+.
+ Python bindings for OpenCV. (Optional, but required by a lot of features)
+ TensorFlow â‰¥ 1.5, < 2
  * TF is not not required if you only want to use `tensorpack.dataflow` alone as a data processing library
  * TF2 is supported if used in graph mode (and use `tf.compat.v1` when needed)
```
pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/tensorpack/tensorpack.git
# or add `--user` to install to user's local directories
```

>Please note that tensorpack is not yet stable.
>If you use tensorpack in your code, remember to mark the exact version of tensorpack you use as your dependencies.
